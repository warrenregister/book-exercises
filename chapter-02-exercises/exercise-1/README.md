# Exercise 1
This exercise is a brief review of terminal commands.

Open up your command-line terminal, and perform the following tasks (no need to fork or download this repository):

```bash
# Navigate to your "Documents" directory
cd ~/Documents/

# Create a new folder called "quick-exercise"
mkdir quick-exercise

# Navigate into the "quick-exercise" folder you just created
cd ~/quick-exercise/

# Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new (empty) file
# called "constitution.txt" inside the "quick-exercise" folder you made
touch constitution.txt
open constitution.txt -a 'Atom'

# List the contents of the folder to verify the new file is there
ls

# Search online for the text of the US Constitution and paste it into the 
# "constitution.txt" file you created. Save your changes through the editor.


# Display the contents of the "constitution.txt" file in the terminal
# Hint: use the `less` command so you can easily scroll up and down.
less constitution.txt

# Navigate to the "Desktop" folder for your machine
cd ~/../Desktop/

# Display the contents of the "Documents/quick-exercise/constitution.txt" file in the Terminal
# *without changing directories again!*

less ../Documents/quick-exercise/constitution.txt

# Bonus: Create 10 files with one single command in your terminal. Then delete them all!
touch {1..10}.txt
rm {1..10}.txt


```
