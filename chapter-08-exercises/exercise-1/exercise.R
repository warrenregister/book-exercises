# Exercise 1: creating and accessing lists

# Create a vector `my_breakfast` of everything you ate for breakfast
my_breakfast <- c('toast', 'peanut butter')

# Create a vector `my_lunch` of everything you ate (or will eat) for lunch
my_lunch <- c('hotdog', 'ketsup')

# Create a list `meals` that has contains your breakfast and lunch
meals <- list(breakfast = my_breakfast, lunch = my_lunch)

# Add a "dinner" element to your `meals` list that has what you plan to eat 
# for dinner
my_dinner <- c('chicken', 'yogurt')
meals$dinner <- my_dinner
# Use dollar notation to extract your `dinner` element from your list
# and save it in a vector called 'dinner'
meals$dinner

# Use double-bracket notation to extract your `lunch` element from your list
# and save it in your list as the element at index 5 (no reason beyond practice)
meals[[2]]
# Use single-bracket notation to extract your breakfast and lunch from your list
# and save them to a list called `early_meals`
early_meals <- list(unlist(meals['breakfast'], use.names = FALSE), unlist(meals['lunch'], use.names = FALSE))


### Challenge ###

# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
# Hint: use the `lappy()` function to apply the `length()` function to each item
num_meal_items <- lapply(meals, length)

# Write a function `add_pizza` that adds pizza to a given meal vector, and
# returns the pizza-fied vector
add_pizza <- function(name_vector){
  return(append(name_vector, 'pizza', after = nchar(name_vector)))
}

# Create a vector `better_meals` that is all your meals, but with pizza!
better_meals <- unlist(meals, use.names = FALSE)
better_meals <- add_pizza(better_meals)
better_meals
